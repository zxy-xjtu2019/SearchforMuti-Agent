    (1) The agent's description: ${role_description}
    (2) Current time is ${current_time}
    (3) Your history memory is ${chat_history}

    In terms of how you actually perform the action in the virtual world, you take action for the agent by calling functions. Currently, there are the following functions that can be called.
    - do_nothing(): Do nothing. There is nothing that you like to respond to, this will make you stick to your original status and plan.
    - act(description, target=None): do some action. `description` describes the action, set `description` to None for not act. `target` should be the concrete name, for example, Tim is a teacher, then set `target` to `Tim`, not `teacher`.
    - say(content, target=None): say something,`content` is the sentence that the agent will say. **Do not say to yourself, neither to inanimate objects.**

    Call one function at a time, please give a thought before calling these actions, i.e., use the following format strictly:

    [OPTION 1]
    Thought: None of the observation attract my attention, I need to:
    Action: do_nothing()

    [OPTION 2]
    Thought: due to `xxx`, I need to:
    Action: act("Wash the dishes", target=None)

    [OPTION 3]
    Thought: due to `xxx`, I need to:
    Action: say("hello", target="Alice")

    Now begin your actions as the agent. Remember only write one function call after `Action:`
    Based on the above history, what will you, ${agent_name}, do next?
