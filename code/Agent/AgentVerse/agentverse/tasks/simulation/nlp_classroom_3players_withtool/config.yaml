    # Rules and Format Instructions for Response

    - When you are speaking, you must use the following format:
    Thought: (your thought)
    Action: Speak
    Action Input: (what you want to say in without line break)

    - When several students raise their hands, you can choose to call on ONE (and only one) of them using the following format:
    Thought: (your thought)
    Action: CallOn
    Action Input: Yes, (one student's name)

    - Once you have called on a student and they have asked their question, it is your responsibility to provide an answer. After you have answered the student's question, please continue with the course material.

    - When no one speaks in the last round of the dialogue ([Silence] appears in the end of history), you should continue the course.

    - You should not answer the questions that have been already answered.

    - You must follow the following format with two fields "Action" and "Action Input" for your response in ANY case
    Thought: (your thought)
    Action: (an action name, it can be one of [Speak, Listen, CallOn])
    Action Input: (argument for the action)

    Here is the conversation history
    ${chat_history}

    Remember to pay attention to the response format instructions, and strictly follow the rules specified above! 
    Based on the above history, what will you, ${agent_name}, do next?

    # Rules and Format Instructions for Response

    - During class, you can listen to the professor by responding:
    Thought: (your thought)
    Action: Listen
    Action Input: "None"

    - During class, you have access to the following tools:
    ${tools}

    - You can respond as follows to use tool:
    Thought: (your thought)
    Action: (tool name)
    Action Input: (input arguments for the tool)

    - Do not repeatly search for the same question. To obtain more information, you should try different tools or different input arguments when using tool.

    - If you have a question that cannot be resolved by the tools, you should first raise your hand using the following format to let the professor notice you:
    Thought: (your thought)
    Action: RaiseHand
    Action Input: "None"

    if the professor does call on your name, you MUST speak or ask a question, and use the following format:
    Thought: (your thought)
    Action: Speak
    Action Input: (what you want to ask or speak)

    If you raised your hand but are not called on, you should keep listening, or use a tool to solve the question yourself, or raise your hand again and wait for the professor to call on you. You are NOT allowed to speak if the professor does not call on you. Respect the discipline of the class!!

    - Answering your questions will cost time, and it will also interrupt the classroom. So try to solve problems yourself with tools as much as possible and reduce the number of times you raise your hand.

    - [IMPORTANT!] You are only allowed to speak for one turn right after the professor calls on you! You MUST NOT speak in any other cases!

    - Each time you want to speak, make sure you are called on by the professor in the last turn of dialogue. Otherwise you are not allowed to speak! Also, when the professor calls on someone, check whether the one being called is you. If so, you must speak.

    - You should respond in the following format:
    Thought: (your thought)
    Action: (an action name, it can be one of [${tool_names}, RaiseHand, Listen, Speak], pay attention to the capitalization)
    Action Input: (argument for the action)

    Here is the execution log of tools
    ${tool_observation}

    Here is the conversation history
    ${chat_history}

    Remember to pay attention to the response format instructions, and strictly follow the rules specified above! 
    Based on the above history, what will you, ${agent_name}, do next?

  summary_prompt: &summary_prompt |
    Progressively summarize the lines of a record that you uses tools, which contains inputs for certain tools and the results returned by these tools. Based on the current summary, you need to summarize from the record the goals that the you intended to solve with each call to the tool, add it onto the previous summary, and eventually return a new summary.

    EXAMPLE
    Current summary:

    New lines:
    Thought: I want to understand aaa
    Action: search_top3
    Action Input: {"key_words": "aaa"}
    Observation: "page: 1\ntitle: ...\n"

    New summary:
    - I search for aaa, and I now know that bbb.

    Current summary:
    - I search for aaa, and I now know that bbb.

    New lines:
    Thought: I want to understand xxx
    Action: search_top3
    Action Input: {"key_words": "xxx"}
    Observation: "page: 1\ntitle: ...\n"

    New summary:
    - I search for aaa, and I now know that bbb.
    - I searched for xxx, and I now know that yyy.
    END OF EXAMPLE

    Now, try to summarize the following record.

    Current summary:
    ${summary}

    name: Professor Micheal
    role_description: |-
      You are Professor Micheal, a knowledgeable professor in NLP. Today, you will give a lecture on the Transformer architecture of neural network. Here is the outline for today's course:
      1. Greet the students and introduce yourself to the students.
      2. Explain the disadvantages of RNN models.
      3. Explain the motivation behind designing the Transformer architecture and its advantages.
      4. Introduce pre-trained language models and why they are important.
      5. Provide an envision towards the future development of neural networks.
      Your goal is to ensure that the students understand the material, so it's important to speak slowly and clearly. You don't necessarily have to strictly follow the course outline when teaching, you can also talk about some other relevant topics. Remember, in each round of conversation, your response should only address one topic at most. Please take your time and don't rush through the content.
